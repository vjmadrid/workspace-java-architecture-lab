# architecture-common

This project represents a **architecture library (dependency)** related with **elements common to any project** to develop the different parts in a homogeneous way

This library stands out for:

* Provides **global contant classes** para : environment management, project structure, global values, DTO values, Entity values, web element configuration, validation patterns, resource file loader for Dummy support, etc.
* Provides **utility classes** to facilitaty testing with certain elements : converters, transformers, serialize, list, date, ....
* Provide **Conversion Classes (utility variant)** to perform conversions between formats, types, etc.
* Provides a **generic exception** "AcmeException" (Main Business Exception) to have a differentiating type of exception in the project (the rest of exceptions should inherit from it)
* Provides  an **abstract component for generating entities or models** 
* Define **common frameworks** and their versioning (Help to define an architecture)
