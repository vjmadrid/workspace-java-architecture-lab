# architecture-common

This project represents a **architecture library (dependency)** related with **elements common to any project** to develop the different parts in a homogeneous way

This library stands out for:

* Provides **global contant classes**
* Provides **utility classes** to facilitaty testing with certain elements : converters, transformers, etc.
* Provides a **generic exception** "AcmeException" (Main Business Exception) to have a differentiating type of exception in the project (the rest of exceptions should inherit from it)
* Provides  an **abstract component for generating entities or models** 
* Define **common frameworks** and their versioning (Help to define an architecture)

## Technological Stack

* Java 8
* [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management

Dependencies with architecture projects

* **architecture-testing** [1.0.0-SNAPSHOT] : Architecture library for testing used in the test environment

## Prerequisites

Define what elements are needed to install the software

* Java 8 installed (1.5+ version required)
* Maven installed  (3+)
