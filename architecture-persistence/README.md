# architecture-persistence

This project represents a **architecture library (dependency)** related with **persistence** to develop the different parts in a homogeneous way

This library stands out for:

* Provides  a proposal of generic interface** to implement **repositories**
* Provides a proposal for **implementation** of the **generic interface** for **in-memory use** (List and Map)
* Provides **utility classes** to facilitate developments on persistence
* Define the **persistence frameworks** and their versioning


## Technological Stack
