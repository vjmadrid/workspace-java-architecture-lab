# architecture-testing

This project represents a **architecture library (dependency)** related with **testing** to develop the different parts in a homogeneus way

This library stands out for:

* Provides **utility classes** to facilitaty testing with certain elements : exceptions, constant classes, etc. 
* Define **unit testing framework** and their versioning
* Define **mocking testing framework** and their versioning
* Define **matcher testing framework** and their versioning





## Technological Stack

* Java 8
* [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management

Dependencies with architecture projects

N/A

Third Party Dependencies

* **assertj-core** [3.15.0] : Matching / asserts framework
* **mockito** [3.3.3] : Mocking framework
* **junit 4** [4.13] : Unit test framework (Version 4)

* **junit-platform-runner** [1.6.0] : Platform unit test framework v5 (Add JUnit Platform + TestEngine API) -> Basic execute test
* **junit-jupiter-engine** [5.6.0] : Unit test framework v5 (Add JUnit Platform + API) Use write test (include : annotations, etc.) (Version 5)
* **junit-vintage-engine** [5.6.0] : Unit test framework for execute JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 (Add JUnit 4.13 transitively depends version vintage)

* **archunit-junit5-api** [0.13.1] : assert architecture rules framework (support junit5)





## Prerequisites

Define what elements are needed to install the software

* Java 8 installed (1.5+ version required)
* Maven installed  (3+)





## Installation

Steps to follow 

* Start a terminal
* To be located in the PATH of installation (the place where the project is located)
* Verify that the file "pom.xml" is available

Execute the following command

```bash
mvn clean install
```

The result will be the generation of an artifact in your Maven repository (local)
