# architecture-testing-spring

This project represents a **architecture library (dependency)** related with **testing** (when depends of Spring Framework) to develop the different parts in a homogeneus way

This library stands out for:

* Provides **utility classes** to facilitaty testing with certain elements : exceptions, constant classes, etc. 
* Define **unit testing framework** and their versioning
* Define **mocking testing framework** and their versioning
* Define **matcher testing framework** and their versioning
* Define **architecture testing framework** and their versioning
* Provides a set of **architecture rules** for Spring Framework  with different scopes of action and/or conventions (name, implementations, etc.)
* Provides others **support/help frameworks** by Spring (JSONassert, JsonPath, etc.)
* It includes certain technologies in order to provide support at the architectural rules level.



Build / deployment conditions :
