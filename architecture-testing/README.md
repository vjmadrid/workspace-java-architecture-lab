# architecture-testing

This project represents a **architecture library (dependency)** related with **testing** to develop the different parts in a homogeneus way

This library stands out for:

* Provides **utility classes** to facilitaty testing with certain elements : exceptions, constant classes, etc. 
* Define **unit testing framework** and their versioning
* Define **mocking testing framework** and their versioning
* Define **matcher testing framework** and their versioning
* Define **architecture testing framework** and their versioning
* Define **logging testing framework** and their versioning
* Provides **unit test reporting**
* Provides a set of **architecture rules**  with different scopes of action and/or conventions (name, implementations, etc.)



Build / deployment conditions :

* Deployment as a library





## Technological Stack

* Java 8
* [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management

## Prerequisites

Define what elements are needed to install the software

* Java 8 installed (1.5+ version required)
* Maven installed  (3+)





## Installation

Steps to follow 

* Start a terminal
* To be located in the PATH of installation (the place where the project is located)
* Verify that the file "pom.xml" is available

Execute the following command

```bash
mvn clean install
```

The result will be the generation of an artifact in your Maven repository (local)
